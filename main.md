Ideas take shape in matter. My words therefore reach you within a specific medium---paper,
audio file, or an electronic text---which serves as a conduit for the transmission of
information. Aristotle, in his *Poetics*, similarly differentiated between the objects or
content of art, its medium, and the mode of mimesis [@aristotle, 90]. Prose describing the way
a bird sings, for example, finds its object of imitation in actual bird songs, further
expressed in the medium of written language. Charlie Parker's style of playing imitated birds
musically, through his saxophone, where the American ornithologist John James Audubon painted
his birds in watercolor. Yet even in this distinction between media, we find a difference in
the modality of perception and comprehension. Of the mode Aristotle mentions only the contrast
between an author "speaking in one's own person" and speaking with other people "engaged" in
mimesis.  Here, I imagine an actor turning to the camera to address the audience, thus shifting
the interpretive perspective from an intra-diegetic vantage to an extra-diegetic one. Be quiet,
the actor says. But I know they don't mean it. The directive merely plays with convention.
Contemplated in somber silence of an art house theater it gains almost a philosophical
significance, though I would prefer to understand it amongst the clamor of a local pub movie
night. Some of you might similarly prefer to read a novel in the comfort of your own home,
while others enjoy the sense of a community and deep discussion that happens in book clubs, on
online forums, or in class. However we read, a text in its abstract sense must pass into print
to become a reified object, a book thing. It will take shape on paper or on a screen and then
once again rarefy into thought by diffusion into its bodily and social contexts.

I write "bodily and social" contexts because if we are to consider texts in their complexity,
we must not
