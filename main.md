The interpretation of texts is complicated by the fact that ideas take shape in matter. My
words therefore reach you within a specific medium---paper, audio file, or an electronic
text---which serves as a conduit for the transmission of information. Aristotle, in his
*Poetics*, similarly differentiated between the objects or content of art, its medium, and the
mode of mimesis [@aristotle, 90]. Prose describing the way a bird sings, for example, finds its
object of imitation in actual bird songs, further expressed in the medium of written language.
Charlie Parker's style of playing imitated birds musically, through his saxophone, where the
American ornithologist John James Audubon painted his birds in watercolor. Yet even this
distinction between media fails to capture the difference in the modality of perception or
comprehension. Of the mode Aristotle mentions only the contrast between an author "speaking in
one's own person" and speaking with other people "engaged" in mimesis.  Here, I imagine an
actor turning to the camera to address the audience, thus shifting the interpretive perspective
from an intra-diegetic vantage to an extra-diegetic one. Be quiet, the actor says. But I know
they don't mean it. The directive merely plays with convention.  Contemplated in somber silence
of an art house theater it gains almost a philosophical significance, though I would prefer to
watch it amongst the clamor of a local pub movie night. Some of you might similarly prefer to
read a novel in the comfort of your own home, while others enjoy the sense of a community and
deep discussion that happens in book clubs, on online forums, or in class. However we read, a
text in its abstract sense must pass into print to become a reified object, a book thing. It
will take shape on paper or on a screen and then once again rarefy into thought by diffusion
into its bodily and social contexts. At first, we simply wanted to read a book, but in
practice, we now must discuss where and how it is to be understood.

It is quite odd, if you think about it, to believe that objects somehow retain an aura or a
trace of their history: "a handkerchief used by Princess Diana," or "the cigar box owned by
President Kennedy." In some real sense, the historical patina covering these objects is only
imagined. President Kennedy's fingerprints and the tears of Princess Diana have long
disappeared from their physical medium. Their trace cannot be reduced to "mere" physical
characteristics: that is, to actual scratches, stains, or molecules, recoverable from the
object. Rather, the object had to "be there" in some way, acquiring a patina of authenticity.
"Having been there" is what gives the object value, sentimental or otherwise, in a condition
that refuses formal reduction to a set of merely material properties. The high price
contemporary society places on authentic artifacts is therefore a type of magical thinking.
Walter Benjamin's famous essay on the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction appears
to both celebrate and lament the demise of such magic.  "The technique of reproduction detaches
the reproduced object from the domain of tradition," wrote Benjamin. "By making many
reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence. And in permitting
the reproduction to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it
reactivates the object reproduced. These two processes lead to a tremendous shattering of
tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and renewal of mankind"
[@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. And yet, for Benjamin, the easy reproducibility of modern art
forms like film and photography also "emancipates the work of art from its parasitical
dependence on ritual" [@benjamin_work_1969, 217-253]. One could read Benjamin's famous essay as
a piece of technological nostalgia, or as an expose on the magic and superstition latent in
modernist art. Crisis or emancipation? Benjamin feels both, and in doing so he captures the
metaphysical anxiety of the modern age. We desire for our Vermeers to stay special but also for
a Vermeer to hang in every home, peering back at us from a multitude of anonymous
reproductions.

The modern world faces the challenge of authenticity, which we have only began to assimilate:
politically, economically, and philosophically. The ubiquitous holographic certificate of
authenticity on a luxury handbag or on a "Digital Versatile Disk" (how antiquated the DVD
sounds already!) is a cheap band-aid hiding the immaterial nature of these artifacts. Fashion
and software companies are reluctant to talk publicly about piracy,[^ln11-counter] because the
so called "knock-offs" are essentially exact duplicates, often "leaked" from the very same
factories producing the original.

Note that it makes no sense to talk about "what was meant" by the designer of the handbag, the
way textual critic may talk about authorial intention. Nor would it make sense to "correct"
some perceived flaw in the painting by Vermeer. The practice parallel to "textual criticism" in
visual arts is restoration. Although similar to textual criticism in its aims to recover some
notion of the original, crucially, the practice of art restoration takes place without
reproduction. Unlike a critical volume, which essentially reprints the work in its
reconstructed entirety, restoration happens at the site. All "unauthorized" copies constitute a
forgery that competes for attention with the original. One could say that for painting and
handbags "matter is synonymous with meaning," but the sentiment strains at the limits of
critical vocabulary in the tradition that gives us only the binaries of form and content.

The context-dependence of an artifact is not even medium-specific, as Goodman would suggest.
Texts are more allographic than handbags and paintings, but Vermeers and Louis Vuitton purses
are also in some sense perfectly reproducible, like texts.

Technologies like 3D scanning and printing increasingly reduce physical objects to their
textual representation, as is the case with the stereo lithographic document (STL) format that
describes objects for 3D printing.  Here, for example, I reproduce code that describes "a
surface" of a functional gun (the code made available online by *Defense Distributed*, a
self-described civic liberty activist group):

```
22=(
BOUNDED_SURFACE()
B_SPLINE_SURFACE(1,2,((#34104,#34105,#34106),(#34107,#34108,#34109)),

);
```

This piece of code exists in its Platonic ideal *before* the physical artifact.  As costs of
reproduction approach zero, so does the line between an object and its description. Imagine a
world where to think "gun" is also to seamlessly bring one into existence. The erosion of
boundaries between object and idea has a pronounced effect on the governance of goods, felt
precisely at the distinction between the autographic and the allographic. Governments currently
regulate the manufacture and the distribution of guns as artifacts, but how does one regulate
guns as texts and ideas? Any such effort amounts to censorship. What was first regulated under
the regime of property law, now increasingly falls under the regimes of intellectual property
and rights to speech. Where does that leave the practice of textual criticism? In such a world
there can be no distinction between works and texts. Unlike millions of reproduced Vermeers
(which no doubt occupy this world in the form of postcards, posters, and photographs), text is
text. It lies before us in glorious flatness, as thick as a sheet of paper.
