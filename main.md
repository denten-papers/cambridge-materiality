title: Materiality

The interpretation of texts is complicated by the fact that ideas take shape in matter. My
words thus reach you within a specific medium---paper, audio file, or an electronic
text---which serves as a conduit for the transmission of information. Aristotle, in his
*Poetics*, similarly differentiated between the objects or content of art, its medium, and the
mode of mimesis. Prose describing the way a bird sings, for example, finds its object of
imitation in actual bird songs, further expressed in the medium of written language.  Charlie
Parker's style of playing imitated birds musically, through his saxophone, where the American
ornithologist John James Audubon painted his birds in watercolor. Yet even this distinction
between media fails to capture the difference in the modality of perception (and comprehension
also). Of the mode Aristotle mentions only the contrast between an author "speaking in one's
own person" and speaking with "other people engaged" in mimesis.  Consider, for example, a film
actor turning to the camera to address their audience, thus shifting the interpretive
perspective from an intra-diegetic vantage to an extra-diegetic one. Sit still, our actor says.
The directive plays with the convention of theater-going.  Contemplated in somber silence of an
art house theater it almost gains philosophical significance, though I would prefer to watch it
amongst the clamor of a local pub movie night.  Some of you might similarly prefer to read a
novel in the comfort of your own home, while others enjoy the sense of a community and deep
discussion that happens in book clubs, on online forums, or in class. However we read, texts in
their abstract sense must pass into print to become reified objects---book things. They will
take shape on paper or screen, and once again rarefy into thought by diffusion into their
physiological and social contexts. At first, we simply wanted to read a book, but in practice,
we now must discuss where and when it is to be understood. Where and when matter in a way that
prevents us from talking about meaning without context.

The material conditions of a thought can often be disregarded in favor of its ideational
content. When we refer to Zora Neale Hurston's collection of African-American folklore
published under the title *Mules and Men* in 1935, we denote equally the numerous editions of
the work, published since 1935. This allocation usually implies neither her notes nor her
manuscripts, available in parts at the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress; at
the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University; and in the P.K. Yonge Library
of Florida History at the University of Florida.  However, once these documents come into view,
they assert an inexorable pull on the content of the published work. Our awareness of the
auto-ethnographic method at work in Hurston's prose irrevocably changes our perception of the
novel. Rather than seeing it as one thing, we can now perceive a number of related
publications, notes, drafts, and manuscripts, which in their overlapping totality comprise the
general field of the work.  Matter asserts itself through the idea. We are reminded at once of
its palpable effects on abstraction and of its shape-giving influence on the foundations of any
thought.

As a matter of method, to become a materialist, and especially one of a historical ilk, one
must insist on the often inconvenient intrusion of the physical world into the realm of the
ideal. I would prefer to sit back in my armchair and just read Hurston, heeding neither
Gainesville nor New Haven. I would rather forego the messiness of competing manuscripts,
editorial interventions, international editions of the work which slightly alter Hurston's
lexicon, the Harlem Renaissance, her problematic stance toward it, her time at Columbia
University spent with Franz Boas and Margaret Mead, her wealth and her literary patronage, her
poverty, the socio-economic realities of black publishing, or, in her own words, "what white
publishers won't print" (the title of an essay she published in the *Negro Digest* in 1950).
These things interfere with my physical complacency. They force me to stand and to travel. They
fracture the unity of meaning. Where I presumed to interpret and to explain, instead I find a
multiplicity of competing possibilities, errors, and emendations along with my own various
limits and conditions, incommensurate to the lived experience of another. The materialist
method entails hermeneutics embedded and embodied.  To think in one's head is insufficient for
understanding: we must also walk, touch, make, and be discomforted.

## Bertrand Russel in Lahore

In March of 2018, members of our research group and I traveled to Lahore, Pakistan under the
invitation from the Archives and Libraries Department, in Government of the Punjab and the
Punjab Information Technology Board. We were there to present on "Architectures of Knowledge,"
a topic that for me meant the engagement with material culture of print: the study of
book-sharing communities, do-it-yourself book scanning, and illicit archives. As part of the
week's program, we toured the Civil Secretariat complex which houses the Punjab Archives in the
storied Tomb of Anarkali---a solid, octagonal, building that witnessed the Mughal Empire,
colonial rule, and the partition.

The Punjab Archives mostly contain records related to the socio-economic and political history
of the region, from the nineteenth and twentieth century. On location, we observed library
staff treat a stack of fragile materials in a giant metal autoclave chamber, filled with
poisonous gas to destroy mold and insects. Bundles of government records were packaged in
large, white sacks, labeled in red and blue ink reading "Persian Records," "General Medical,"
and "Revenue Agriculture." Ribboned file folders signalled their provenance in a mixture of
print and cursive, indicating such government agencies as Punjab Civil Secretariat or the Home
Department. An exhibition of rare books and manuscripts was arranged around the tomb itself.
An archive official ushered us into a tall, tiered room, where balconies, ladders, and metal
scaffolding that framed the neat rows of small, square storage compartments extending several
stories upward to the ceiling.

I was invited ostensibly as an expert in the digitization of records, to advise on things like
document scanning, optical character recognition, and sustainable digital preservation
practices. But I was also in a sense trespassing, arriving with no relevant language skills and
having only a cursory familiarity with the region's history. Therefore, I listened and observed
with a naive heart. Lahore's rich intellectual traditions encompassed multiple, variegated
topographies. The belief in the radical embeddedness of thought prevents us from making
universal generalizations. Specific material contexts necessitate the understanding *in situ*,
where the hardware of intellectual infrastructure meets the software of its ideational content.
In Lahore, as elsewhere, such sites are located not only in institutional libraries, but also
in coffee shops, home kitchens, and outdoor book markets.

At one such location, next to the King Edward Medical University, we met with a book seller
whom I will call Bilal, the proprietor of Bilal Old Books, a small shop specializing in
"medical, engineering, English, Urdu, and Islamic literature." Judging by the extensive
inventory of medical textbooks, his clientele consisted largely of local medical students. The
volumes, many of them in English, were inexpensive though high-quality reproductions of
cutting-edge medical literature published originally in Europe and the United States. Such
textbooks are either not otherwise available in Pakistan or prohibitively expensive. The alley
leading to Bilal's is one of several connecting a small network of translators, printers,
binders, specialty book sellers, who, together support the needs of their community.

A wall of shelves unlike the others in inside the shop caught my attention. Here, a patron
could find the complete works of Bertrand Russel: his Basic Writings published by Routledge
Classics, his autobiography, his *Unpopular Essays* and *History of Western Philosophy*. Bilal
as it turned out was a serious reader of the British philosopher. Although the books did not
sell well, he maintained this well-stocked corner of the store in hopes of promoting Russel's
thought.

On the way out, after thanking Bilal for his time and hospitality, I purchased a crisp,
off-brand copy of Russel's *On Education*, clearly designated on the cover as a "Special Indian
Edition." Such editions serve a two-fold function for the publisher. First, the British- or
American-specific English lexicon may be substituted for its equivalent in International
English. These changes could also involve editorial suggestions specific to the region, such as
the substitution of Imperial for Metric units of measurement. The second function is economic.
Routledge and other publishers sell their wares at a lower price in the South-Asian market,
creating a cost disparity in relation to their North American and Western European
counterparts. To prevent resale and reuse across regional boundaries, publishers subsequently
introduce arbitrary differences into their international editions. A "Special Indian Edition"
of a textbook on organic chemistry, for example, could be paginated in such a way as to make
weekly reading assignments given by an American university instructor difficult to follow.

The US Supreme Court considered a case related to such international editions in 2012, when the
international conglomerate John Wiley & Sons Inc. (brought a suit against Supap Kirtsaeng, a
citizen of Thailand and then a student at the University of California, who resold textbooks
purchased in Thailand in the United States. The case hinged on the question of whether the
"first sale" doctrine can be limited geographically by countervailing copyright claims. The
judgement in favor of Kirtsaeng explained that Section 106 of the US Copyright Act granted the
copyright owner "certain exclusive rights," including those of sale and the transfer of
ownership. However these rights were qualified by several limitations including the principle
of "fair use" and "first sale." The "first sale" principle grants "the owner of a particular
copy," the right to "sell or otherwise dispose of the possession" provided it was "lawfully
made under this title." We can thus imagine owning a vinyl copy of a recent hit record, in a
case where the artist and their music label own the general rights for distribution, but where
the individual also has the right to dispose of this one, specific record in their possession.
The first owns the right to the work of art in the abstract (and hence to the first sale), and
the second to a singular object of art, and thereafter to the second, sale. In plain language,
Kirtsaeng bought a book and sold it as a used book. But what happens when resale goes global?
Wiley argued that the principle of "first sale" did not in fact extend to copies of their books
purchased outside of the United States. On that view, the phrase "under this title" implied a
geographic restriction. The court ultimately ruled in Kirtsaeng's favor, with the majority of
opinion affirming a non-geographic understanding of the clause. The ruling conceded that its
consequences would make the division between foreign and domestic markets through
discriminatory pricing more difficult, if not impossible. However, it also argued that the US
copyright law did not especially entitle such rights in the first place. Subsequent the ruling,
international students were free to continue reselling their books.

I do not know whether Bilal's photocopied editions of Russel's work would be considered legal
copies under the US copyright law. The question is irrelevant to the students of Pakistan in
the pursuit of a quality education. Our discussion concerns the material life of intellectual
works, which, in this case, have passed through the halls of Trinity College in the United
Kingdom, to Rutledge's international offices in New Delhi, and onto a side street of printers
and booksellers in Lahore. The situated nature of this custody chain prevents us from treating
anything like "literary works" as universal constructs. Meaning, at stake in reading, depends
on the environment, transforming in circulation. Multiple communities---in this case: authors,
students, teachers, book sellers, stock holders, and multinational publishers---diverge in
their goals, charters, practices, socio-economic conditions, and histories. They consequently
diverge in their understanding of the work, in a way that cannot be reconciled neatly into a
singular Russel's *On Education*, true for all time and everywhere.

The story of the book, now on my bookshelf, reminds me also of my own superfluous presence in
Pakistan. The Government of Punjab did not need foreign expertise for digitizing their
archives: local communities have already built a robust infrastructure to support their
intellectual activity. Bilal's street-level network is far more engaged in the material life of
book publishing than an average American scholar. But even on this, local level, there exist
institutional and cultural barriers that prevent the Punjab Archives from becoming a unilateral
thing. The object grounds the work, but also fractures it among specific lived sites. My
reading of Russel is now forever informed by walking the streets of Lahore. In total, a
committed materialism leads not to cultural relativism (there are no facts on which we can
agree), but to a congruence of cultures and communities. A text emerges from the overlapping
congruence of divergent materialities. But even this consensus, once materialized, becomes yet
another waypoint on the topography of the work.

## Historical Materialism

Central to our discussion on materiality so far has been the distinction between the work of
art as an idea and an object. In this regard, the philosopher John Goodman noted the difference
between painting and literature. With painting, we prefer to witness the original. No matter
how high the fidelity, a reproduction loses in perceived value, aesthetic and economic.  By
contrast, few readers of literature care to consult original manuscripts. It is enough to know
that a work belongs to its stated author. Any reproduction will do for the reading.  Matter
thus recedes in the practice of literary criticism in favor of ideational content. Where
painting is embedded in its medium, in a way that makes it difficult to extract, text adheres
lightly, appearing more portable and more amenable to reproduction.

Yet even the most ephemeral of things can also acquire a patina of metaphysical, extra-material
significance.  In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Walter Benjamin
referred to this residue as an "aura." A handkerchief used by Princess Diana may be
indistinguishable from any old handkerchief, down to a molecular level. The article becomes
more valuable however when its noble provenance can be documented. History thus permeates the
artifact, in away that cannot be reduced to physical particularities such as size, type of
cloth, pattern, or the Diana's tears. Are we wrong to place sentimental value on the weightless
tokens of history?  How does this residue adhere to an object?

Hence, the notion of historical materialism contains within it the following contradiction. An
idea arrives onto my bookshelves wrapped within a convenient paper receptacle, to be ingested
and converted back into ideas that live in my head. I am eager to unwrap them and to discard
the package.  Materialist approaches to the study of text aim to reconstitute notational works
in their socio-economic contexts: first, the architecture of the book as an object mediating
inscription, and second, the infrastructure that has made its delivery possible. A materialism
that is historical in addition, views the object as a shape in time. A book in that sense is
more than a perceptual thing in your field of view. It arrives already weathered by the patina
of interpretation and marred by the dust of the ideal.

Finally, we must hold onto both of these extensions of the object: in time and in space. In his
visual compendium of types and methods for architectural drawing, Rendow Yee introduces the
technique of picturing a building in its "expanded" or "exploded" view, by which the viewer is
able to peer inside, as it were, illustrating "the nature of this structure as an assemblage of
standardized parts," showing "how structural components relate to each other," in a way that
also reveals "the genesis" of its construction. If we are to draw the book in in its expanded
view, under a historical materialist paradigm, we would picture not only the object that
appears to view, but also the history of its production: its various translations and editions;
its accrued metadata; related scholarly articles, book reviews, and online book club
discussions; the machinations of the language within; the handprint of typesetters and the
warehouse workers involved in literary circulation.

## Laminate Text

The transition from print to screen further complicates the physical realities of textual
material. In my book, *Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation*, I proposed to view digital
media not as a homogeneous substance, but rather a laminate of technologies, inscriptions, and
protocols. An authorized digital edition of Russel's *On Education* in English is not available
in Pakistan. A digital copy of the Special Indian Edition can be purchased in India, from a
major online retailer, for roughly the equivalent of $26, the same price it fetches on the
American market. The two versions of the text, print and digital, contain ostensibly the same
information. But they differ substantially in they way they could be read, shared, or archived.

My paper copy of the book exists in a single location. I am free to gift it, resell, and
otherwise dispose of it as I please. The digital copy is not technically an object. I have
purchased instead a license to read the text on the retailer's proprietary platform. The very
word "platform" suggest the drastically differing sense of software and hardware architectures
involved. Bits arranged on drives in secured data centers somewhere in the Asia Pacific Region
(likely in Mumbai) represent the equivalent of Russel's text. However, these comprise only a
small part of the information required to facilitate my reading. A great portion of the code
involved specifies the electronic book's virtual affordances: the look and feel of the pages,
the way they will be turned, built-in dictionaries and sponsored advertisements. Digital rights
management (DRM)  safeguards will prevent me from making unauthorized copies of the text and
from reading in locations for which I do not own a license.

The text I see on my screen exists also in part on my personal drive, where the instructions
from the Mumbai server are assembled into synthetic equivalents of words, sentences, chapters,
and pages. On screen, Russel's text takes shape as a configuration of electrodes, color
filters, and light as it shines through the medium of liquid crystal. Modern "solid state"
storage keeps information by charging and millions of tiny "floating gate" transistors. The
pattern of such floating gate thus also in some sense represent Russel's *On Education*. The
physical properties of each laminate differ as do the data encodings at each level. It follows
that the affordances of the text---what can be done with it---also diverge, depending on the
access capabilities of the reader. For example, the reader on screen is often prevented from
copying and pasting information where a user with system privileges may be able to duplicate
the underlying data representation. We are finally dealing with multiple data formats which
present unique challenges for their storage, manipulation, and distribution. The digital copy
of the book I own simulates the affordances of the print book, but only to a surface extent.
Interface metaphors occluding the material realities of digital text do not sustain the legal
notion of ownership as applied to the physical copy.

Access to the underlying layers of representation of the electronic book I purchased in the
South Asian market is stead limited by law and by software. The license allows me to manipulate
pages only in the ways specified by its terms and conditions. "No person shall circumvent a
technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title,"
according to Title 17, Chapter 12, Section 1201 of the United States Code.  Further, to
"circumvent a technological measure," "means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an
encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological
measure, without the authority of the copyright owner" and "to manufacture, import, offer to
the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device,
component, or part thereof, that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of
circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right
of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof." Thus even though I now
own multiple copies of the same text, including one authorized for the American market---what I
can do with each, how I choose to read them and where---differs with the edition.

Legals scholars and activists have long argued against such restrictions. Individually, they
alienate readers from the physicality of printed matter. Consequently, the armature of
intellectual activity becomes enmeshed within the larger structure of corporate surveillance
and state control. Electronic book readers may also serve advertisements, record conversations,
and track their users' location. In aggregate, collective alienation leads to systemic global
inequities. Beneath the surface of electronic text, international publishing conglomerates are
able to monopolize the means of textual production, distribution, and utilization. Publicly
funded research is routinely funneled into private, for-profit concerns that limit access to
those not able to pay. Whole geographic regions, in Eastern Europe and the Global South, find
themselves on the margins of literary and scientific development. Worse still, these systemic
inequities become difficult to perceive or to redress, due to their diffuse technological
complexity. Where Bilal had his makeshift network of book printers and binders, most
proprietary device for electronic readers are simply not available in Pakistan (as of writing
this chapter), while the means of their reproduction informally also lie beyond the immediate
capabilities of local artisans.

The redress of systemic inequities that propagate through digital infrastructure requires our
involvement. In the past decade, a community of librarians and technologists from South Asia
have created a suite of free (as in freedom) software tools under the name of Calibre, designed
to edit, archive, and organize electronic books in numerous, non-proprietary data formats. An
anonymous group of "apprentices" and "custodians" have extended this platform to manipulate
those works under DRM protections. An online project started in Croatia called Memory of the
World has made it possible to host and to share private Calibre libraries. In 2011, a scientist
from Kazakhstan started a website where those users with access to research literatures can
safely provide access to those who do not. A number of so called "shadow-libraries" has emerged
to rival corporate collections in size and coverage. These efforts exist in the legal grey area
of international commerce. The ethics of their use however lies in deep accordance with those
progressive ideals that would sustain fair use through unfettered intellectual activity in the
commons.
