title: Materiality

The interpretation of texts is complicated by the fact that ideas take shape in matter. My
words thus reach you within a specific medium---paper, audio file, or an electronic
text---which serves as a conduit for the transmission of information. Aristotle, in his
*Poetics*, similarly differentiated between the objects or content of art, its medium, and the
mode of mimesis. Prose describing the way a bird sings, for example, finds its object of
imitation in actual bird songs, further expressed in the medium of written language.  Charlie
Parker's style of playing imitated birds musically, through his saxophone, where the American
ornithologist John James Audubon painted his birds in watercolor.

Yet even this distinction between media fails to capture the difference in the modality of
perception (and comprehension also). Of the mode Aristotle mentions only the contrast between
an author "speaking in one's own person" and speaking with "other people engaged" in mimesis.
Consider, for example, a film actor turning to the camera to address their audience, thus
shifting the interpretive perspective from an intra-diegetic vantage to an extra-diegetic one.
Sit still, our actor says.  The directive plays with conventional theater-going habits.
Contemplated in the somber silence of an art house theater it gains philosophical significance,
though I would prefer to watch it amongst the clamor of a local pub movie night. The mode is
also the message.

Some of you might similarly prefer to read a novel in the comfort of your own home, while
others enjoy the sense of a community and deep discussion that happens in book clubs, online,
or in class. However we read, texts in their abstract sense must pass into print to become
reified objects---book things. They will take shape on paper or on screen, and once again
rarefy into thought by diffusion into their physiological and social contexts. At first, we
simply wanted to read a book, but in practice, we now must discuss where and when it is to be
understood. Where and when matter in a way that prevents us from talking about meaning in the
abstract. Meaning, one might say, is always situated.

The material conditions of a thought can often be disregarded in favor of its ideational
content. It bares asking however: What matter is designated under a single title? When we refer
to Zora Neale Hurston's collection of African-American folklore published under the title
*Mules and Men* in 1935, we denote equally the numerous editions of the work, published since
1935. However, this allocation usually excludes the related notes and manuscripts, available in
parts at the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress; at the Beinecke Rare
Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University; and in the P.K. Yonge Library of Florida History
at the University of Florida. Once these additional documents come into view, they assert an
inexorable pull on the content of the published work. Our awareness of the auto-ethnographic
method at work in Hurston's prose irrevocably changes our perception of the novel. Rather than
seeing it as one thing, we can now perceive a number of related publications, notes, drafts,
and manuscripts, which in their overlapping totality comprise the general field of the work.
Matter asserts itself through the idea. We are reminded at once of its palpable effects on
abstraction and of its shape-giving influence on the foundations of any thought.

Methodologically, a materialist approach, and especially historically-inflected materialism,
would insist on the often inconvenient intrusion of the physical world into the realm of the
ideal. I would prefer to sit back in my armchair and just read Hurston, heeding neither
Gainesville nor New Haven. I would rather forego the messiness of conflicting manuscript
witnesses, editorial interventions, and international editions of the work which have, over the
years, altered and normalized Hurston's language to better accord to publishing standards.  It
is easier to just read, without a thought for Harlem Renaissance, Hurston's problematic stance
toward it, her time at Columbia University spent with Franz Boas and Margaret Mead, her
literary patronage, her sometime poverty, the socio-economic realities of black publishing, or,
in her own words, for "what white publishers won't print" (the title of an essay she published
in the *Negro Digest* in 1950). These things disturb the surface of the text, as they do my
mind and posture. They force me to stand and travel. They fracture the unity of meaning.  Where
I presumed to interpret and to explain, instead I find a multiplicity of competing
possibilities, errors, and emendations along with my own various limits and conditions,
incommensurate to the lived, written experience of another. A materialist method entails
hermeneutics embedded and embodied. To think in one's head is insufficient for understanding:
we must also walk, touch, make, and be unsettled.

## Bertrand Russel in Lahore

In March of 2018, members of our research group and I traveled to Lahore, Pakistan under the
invitation from the Archives and Libraries Department, in Government of the Punjab and the
Punjab Information Technology Board. We were there to present on "Architectures of Knowledge,"
a topic that for me meant the engagement with material culture of print: the study of online
book-sharing communities, do-it-yourself book scanning technology, and illicit archives. As
part of the week's program, we toured the Civil Secretariat complex which houses the Punjab
Archives in the storied Tomb of Anarkali---a solid, octagonal building that witnessed the
Mughal Empire, colonial rule, and the partition.

The Punjab Archives mostly contain records related to the socio-economic and political history
of the region, from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. On location, we observed library
staff treat a stack of fragile materials in a giant metal autoclave chamber, filled with
poisonous gas to destroy mold and insects. Bundles of government records were packaged in
large, white sacks labeled in red and blue ink reading "Persian Records," "General Medical,"
and "Revenue Agriculture." Ribboned file folders signalled their provenance in a mixture of
print and cursive, indicating such government agencies as Punjab Civil Secretariat or the Home
Department. An exhibition of rare books and manuscripts was arranged around the tomb itself.
An archive official ushered us into a tall, tiered room where balconies, ladders, and metal
scaffolding framed several neat rows of small, square storage compartments extending several
stories upward to the ceiling.

I was invited ostensibly as an expert in the digitization of records, to advise on things like
document scanning, optical character recognition, and sustainable digital preservation
practices. But I was also in a sense trespassing, arriving with no relevant language skills and
having only a cursory familiarity with the region's history. Therefore, I listened and observed
with a naive heart. Lahore's rich intellectual traditions encompassed multiple, variegated
topographies. The belief in the radical embeddedness of thought prevents us from making
universal generalizations. Specific material contexts necessitate the understanding *in situ*,
where the hardware of intellectual infrastructure meets the software of ideational content.  In
Lahore, as elsewhere, such sites are located not only in institutional libraries, but also in
coffee shops, home kitchens, and outdoor book markets.

At one such location, next to the King Edward Medical University, we met with a book seller
whom I will call Bilal, the proprietor of Bilal Old Books, a small shop specializing in
"medical, engineering, English, Urdu, and Islamic literature." Judging by the extensive
inventory of medical textbooks, his clientele consisted largely of local medical students. The
volumes, many of them in English, were inexpensive though high-quality reproductions of
cutting-edge medical literature published originally in Europe and the United States. Such
textbooks are either not otherwise available in Pakistan or prohibitively expensive there. The
alley leading to Bilal's shop is one of several connecting a small network of translators,
printers, binders, specialty book sellers, who, together support the needs of their community.

A wall of shelves unlike the others inside the shop caught my attention. Here, a patron could
find the complete works of Bertrand Russel: his Basic Writings published by Routledge Classics,
his autobiography, his *Unpopular Essays* and *History of Western Philosophy*. Bilal, as it
turned out, was a serious reader of the British philosopher. Although these works did not sell
well, he maintained a well-stocked corner of the store in hopes of promoting Russel's thought.

On the way out, after thanking Bilal for his time and hospitality, I purchased a crisp,
off-brand copy of Russel's *On Education*, clearly designated on the cover as a "Special Indian
Edition." Such editions serve a two-fold function for the publisher. First, the British- or
American-specific English lexicon may be substituted for its equivalent in International
English. Changes like these could also involve editorial suggestions specific to the region,
such as the substitution of Imperial for Metric units of measurement. The second function is
economic.  Routledge and other publishers sell their wares at a lower price in the South-Asian
market, creating a cost disparity in relation to their North American and Western European
counterparts. To prevent resale and reuse across regional boundaries, publishers subsequently
introduce arbitrary differences into their international editions. A "Special Indian Edition"
of a textbook on organic chemistry, for example, could be re-paginated slightly, so as to make
weekly reading assignments given by an American university instructor difficult to follow.
There was no way of knowing whether my "Special Indian Edition" contained any such changes
without comparing it to other similar volumes.

The US Supreme Court considered a case related to special international editions in 2012, when
the British-based publisher John Wiley & Sons Inc. brought a suit against Supap Kirtsaeng, a
citizen of Thailand. Then a student at the University of California, Kirtsaeng had his
textbooks sent from home. He then resold them locally to recoup costs. The case hinged on the
question of whether the doctrine of the "first sale" could be limited geographically by
countervailing copyright claims. If Kirtsaeng bought his materials in Thailand lawfully, could
he subsequently sell them in the United States on the used market? The judgement in favor of
the defendant explained that Section 106 of the US Copyright Act granted copyright owners (John
Wiley, in this case) "certain exclusive rights," including those of exclusive original sale.
However, these rights were also limited by the doctrines of "fair use" and "first sale." Fair
use, according Section 107 of U.S. Copyright Law, does not infringe on copyrights, "for
purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for
classroom use), scholarship, or research." The "first sale" principle in Section 109 grants
"the owner of a particular copy," the right to "sell or otherwise dispose of the possession"
provided it was "lawfully made under this title." We can thus imagine owning a vinyl copy of a
recent hit record, in a case where the artist and their music label own the general rights for
distribution, but where the individual also has the right to dispose of this one, specific
record in their possession on the second-hand market. The first party hence owns the right to
the work of art in the abstract (and hence to the first sale), and the second, to a singular
object of art, and thereafter to the second sale.

In light of the above statues, we may surmise that Kirtsaeng had second sale rights to his
property. But what happens when resale goes global?  Wiley argued that the principle of first
sale did not in fact extend to copies purchased outside of the United States. On that view, the
phrase "lawfully made under this title" implied a geographic, as well as a legal restriction.
In their interpretation, the defendant bought the books lawfully but not under U.S.
jurisdiction. The court ultimately ruled in Kirtsaeng's favor, with the majority of opinion
affirming a non-geographic understanding of the clause. The ruling conceded that its
consequences would make the division between foreign and domestic markets through
discriminatory pricing more difficult, if not impossible. However, it also argued that the U.S.
copyright law did not especially entitle geographic price discrimination in the first place.
Subsequent the ruling, international students were free to continue reselling their books.

I do not know whether Bilal's photocopied editions of Russel's work would be considered legal
copies under the US copyright law. The question is irrelevant to Pakistani students in the
pursuit of a quality education. Our discussion concerns the material life of intellectual
works, which, in this case, have passed through the halls of Trinity College in the United
Kingdom, to Rutledge's international offices in New Delhi, and onto a side street of printers
and booksellers in Lahore. The situated nature of this custody chain prevents us from treating
anything like a "literary work" as a universal construct. Meaning, at stake in reading, depends
on the environment. It transforms in circulation. Multiple communities---in this case, authors,
students, teachers, book sellers, stock holders, and multinational publishers---diverge in
their goals, charters, practices, socio-economic conditions, and histories. They consequently
diverge in their understanding of the work, in a way that cannot be reconciled neatly into a
singular Russel's *On Education*, true for all time and everywhere. My goal as a literary
scholar is to simultaneously read Russel on his own ideational terms and to follow his works
physically through their specific, material instantiations.

The story of the book, now on my bookshelf, reminds me of my own superfluous presence in
Pakistan. The Government of Punjab did not need foreign expertise for digitizing their
archives: local communities have already built a robust infrastructure to support their various
intellectual activities. Bilal's street-level network is far more engaged in the material life
of book publishing than an average American scholar. But even on this, local level, there exist
institutional and cultural barriers that prevent the Punjab Archives from becoming a
unilateral, uniform thing. The object grounds the work, but also fractures it among specific
lived sites. My reading of Russel is now forever informed by walking the streets of Lahore. In
total, a committed materialism leads not to cultural relativism (there are no facts on which we
can agree), but to a congruence of cultures, communities, and interpretations. A text emerges
from the many-voiced consensus of local perspectives. This agreement, once materialized,
becomes yet another waypoint within the topography delimiting a work.

## Laminate Text

The transition from print to screen further complicates the physical realities of textual
material. In my book, *Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation*, I proposed to view digital
media not as a homogeneous substance, but rather a laminate of technologies, inscriptions, and
protocols. An authorized digital edition of Russel's *On Education* in English is not available
in Pakistan. A digital copy of the Special Indian Edition can be purchased in India, from a
major online retailer, for roughly the equivalent of $26, the same price it fetches on the
American market. The two versions of the text, print and digital, contain ostensibly the same
information. But they differ substantially in they way they can be read, shared, and archived.

The vocabulary of electrical engineering and user experience design gives us a way of thinking
about books as digital objects in a language that differs from that of literary theory or media
studies. Consider US Patent 20130219270A1, granted in 2018 to Apple, Inc. out of Cupertino,
California. The patent materials relate to "displaying and facilitating the manipulation of
electronic text of an electronic book (eBook) being read on an electronic device." "Much like
an ordinary book,"

> electronic books can be used to present text and pictures to readers. Instead of ink and
paper, however, an electronic book is a collection of digital data that software, known as an
electronic book reader application, can interpret and present on a display.

These opening statements give us a sense of the laminates involved. The electronic text
comprises "a collection digital data," its "software interpretation," and "presentation on a
display." These technologies are then placed secondary to what the patent describes as a book's
"first publication," that is, some notion of a canonical imprint, in relation to which all
others are secondary. The patent therefore concerns itself with the chain of events that begins
with deriving the source of a first publication, for example as when the electronic reader
queries a library database to confirm that the original source of some particular material was
indeed a magazine article, as opposed to a novel. Based on that initial query, the system
creates a "representation of the first publication," in our example, an appropriately formatted
digital facsimile of a magazine (as opposed to a book).  Additionally, the system places that
first publication into a "state," indicating a difference for instance between a magazine that
has been newly purchased as opposed to one recently read. States and labels may further involve
information about users, such as their location, for example, or about other items found on
their bookshelf. In the words of the patent: "determining the state for the first publication
may include determining a location for a first device, determining that content appearing in
the electronic bookshelf is associated with the location, and presenting the content to the
user indicating that the content is relevant to the location." Presenting such content may
"include a ribbon to indicate relevance" or "placing the content using a specified book
location" in relation to other material. In other words, my virtual book items may change their
virtual state or location in response to my handling of over virtual items, states, or
locations.

The language of patents by necessity, forces their authors to describe objects as if
encountering the world anew, from an alien perspective (in order to protect their original
claim). Nothing can be taken for granted: not the way books look nor the way we read them. The
conceptual displacement reveals the supposed novelty of the proposed invention, affecting also
our own perception of now habituated objects, such as word processors and electronic books.
Exacting technical description, diagrams, and drawings satisfy a scholarly curiosity about the
inner workings of machines that are usually sealed and which therefore resist description and
interpretation. Criticism by disassembly anchors theoretical insight within the material
realities of the artifact.

My paper copy of Russel's book exists in a single location. I am free to gift it, resell, and
otherwise dispose of it as I please. The digital copy is not technically a single object. I
have purchased instead a license to read the text within the technical confines of the
retailer's proprietary platform. The very word "platform" suggests the implicit scaffolding of
software and hardware architectures involved. Bits arranged on drives in secured data centers
somewhere in the Asia Pacific Region (likely in Mumbai) represent the equivalent of Russel's
text. However, these comprise only a small part of the information required to facilitate my
reading. A great portion of the code involved specifies the electronic book's virtual
affordances: the look and feel of the pages, the way they will be turned, built-in dictionaries
and sponsored advertisements. Digital rights management (DRM) safeguards will prevent me from
making unauthorized copies of the text and from reading it in locations for which I do not own
a license.

The text I see on my screen exists also in part on my personal drive, where the instructions
from the Mumbai server are assembled into synthetic equivalents of words, sentences, chapters,
and pages. On screen, Russel's text takes shape as a configuration of electrodes, color
filters, and light as it shines through glass substrates. Modern non-volatile computer memory
storage medium keeps information by charging and discharging  millions of tiny "floating gate"
transistors, allowing for logical operators such as NOT and AND. Russel's *On Education* is
thus represented as a pattern of electrically charged floating gates in one stratum of
inscription (in memory), and, in another, as a pattern of twisted nematic liquid crystal (on
screen). The physical properties of each laminate differ as do the data encodings at each
level. It follows that the affordances of the text---what can be done with it---also diverge,
depending on readers' privileges. For example, a reader on screen is often prevented from
copying and pasting information, where users with access to the underlying data structure on
disk, are not. We are ultimately dealing with multiple data formats which present unique
challenges for their storage, manipulation, and distribution. The digital copy of the book I
own simulates the affordances of the print book, but only to a surface extent. I "turn pages,"
"read," "take notes," "copy," "paste," "share," and "own" books only by metaphor. The familiar
words occlude remote material realities: floating gates and liquid crystal, where reading and
writing require highly specialized tools, alien gestures.

Law and software limits access to the underlying layers of representation of the electronic
book I purchased in the South Asian market. My application license allows me to manipulate
purchased pages only in the ways specified by its terms and conditions. According to Title 17,
Chapter 12, Section 1201 of the United States Code, "No person shall circumvent a technological
measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title." Further, to
"circumvent a technological measure," "means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an
encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological
measure, without the authority of the copyright owner" and "to manufacture, import, offer to
the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device,
component, or part thereof, that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of
circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right
of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof." Thus even though I now
own multiple copies of the same text, including one authorized for the American market---what I
can do with each, how I choose to read them and where---differs with the edition.

Legals scholars and activists have long argued against restrictions placed on electronic text.
Individually, such restrictions alienate readers from the physicality of printed matter.
Consequently, the armature of intellectual activity becomes enmeshed within the larger
structure of corporate surveillance and state control. Electronic book readers routinely serve
advertisements, record conversations, and track their users' location. In aggregate, collective
alienation leads to systemic global inequities. Beneath the surface of electronic text,
international publishing conglomerates are able to monopolize the means of textual production,
distribution, and utilization. Publicly funded research is funneled into private, for-profit
concerns that limit access to those not able to pay. Whole geographic regions, in Eastern
Europe and the Global South, find themselves on the margins of literary and scientific
development. Worse still, these systemic inequities become difficult to redress or even to
recognize, due to their diffuse technological complexity.  For example, proprietary electronic
book readers are simply not available in Pakistan (as of writing this chapter). The means of
their reproduction informally also lie beyond the immediate capabilities of local artisans like
Bilal. As education is moving online, digital platforms threaten to further entrench economic
disparities between those with access to scholarly knowledge and those without.

A number of recent projects attempt to redress such systemic inequities by means of epistemic,
technological activism. For example, a community of librarians and technologists from South
Asia have created a suite of free (as in freedom) software tools under the name of Calibre,
designed to edit, archive, and organize electronic books in numerous, non-proprietary data
formats. An anonymous group of "apprentices" and "custodians" have extended this platform to
manipulate those works under DRM protections. An online project started in Croatia called
Memory of the World has made it possible to host and to share private Calibre libraries. In
2011, a scientist from Kazakhstan started a website where those users with access to research
literatures can safely provide access to those who do not. Numerous so called
"shadow-libraries" have emerged to rival corporate digital collections in size and coverage.
These efforts operate in the legal grey area of international commerce. The ethics of their use
however lies in deep accordance with those progressive ideals that would sustain fair use
through unfettered intellectual activity in the commons.

## Historical Materialism

Central to our discussion on materiality so far has been the distinction between the work of
art as an idea and as an object. In this regard, it may be useful to recall the distinction
between painting and literature made by the philosopher Nelson Goodman in his 1968 classic
*Languages of Art*.  With painting, he explained, we prefer to witness the original. No matter
how high the fidelity, a reproduction loses in perceived value, aesthetic and economic.  By
contrast, few readers of literature care to consult original manuscripts. It is enough to know
that a work belongs to its stated author.  Any reproduction will do for the reading.  Matter
thus recedes in the practice of literary criticism in favor of ideational content. Where
paint is embedded in its medium, in a way that makes it difficult to extract, text adheres
lightly, appearing more portable and more amenable to reproduction.

Yet even the most ephemeral of things such as text can also acquire a patina of a metaphysical,
extra-material significance. In 1936, Walter Benjamin famously referred to this residue as an
"aura," lost by the work of art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. A handkerchief used by
Princess Diana may be indistinguishable from any old handkerchief, down to a molecular level.
The article becomes more valuable however when its noble provenance can be documented. History
thus permeates the artifact, in a way that cannot be reduced to physical particularities such
as size, type of cloth, pattern, or the Diana's tears.  Are we wrong to place sentimental value
on such weightless tokens of history?  How does this residue adhere to an object?

Hence, the notion of historical materialism contains within it the following contradiction. An
idea arrives onto my bookshelves wrapped within a convenient paper receptacle, to be ingested
and converted back into ideas that live in my head. I am eager to unwrap them and to discard
the package. Materialist approaches to the study of text aim to reconstitute notational works
within their socio-economic contexts. The book appears first as a medium, the architecture of
inscription (book bindings, ink, shelves, stacks) and second, as a modality, its habitual
vestments (comportment, customs, body posture). A materialism that is historical in addition
views the object in time. A book in that sense is more than a perceptual thing in our
perceptual field. It arrives already weathered by the patina of interpretation, marred by the
dust of the ideal.

Finally, we must hold onto both of these extensions of the object: in time and in space. In his
visual compendium of types and methods for architectural drawing, Rendow Yee describes the
technique of picturing a building in its "expanded" or "exploded" view, by which the viewer is
able to peer inside, as it were, illustrating "the nature of this structure as an assemblage of
standardized parts," showing "how structural components relate to each other," in a way that
also reveals "the genesis" of its construction. If we are to draw the book in its expanded
form, under the paradigm of historical materialism, we would picture not only the object that
appears to view, but also the history of its production: its various translations and editions;
its accrued metadata; related scholarly articles, book reviews, and online book club
discussions; the machinations of the language within; the handprint of typesetters and the
warehouse workers involved in literary circulation.
